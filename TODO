TODO LIST:
==========
- add support for interpolation when staging data to shared memory

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- pretty-printing C-code: currently, the following OpenCL attributes are not
  supported: __attribute__ ((max_constant_size(<size>)))
  image type qualifiers: __write_only, __read_only, __read_write
- pass 'CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE' as parameter to the OpenCL barrier command instead
  of the integer constant '0'
