HIPACC Prerequisites:
=====================

Cmake (2.8 or later)
LLVM (trunk)
Clang (trunk)
libcxx (trunk)
Polly (trunk - optional)


Installation:
=============

To configure the project, call cmake in the root directory. A working
installation of Clang/LLVM (and Polly) is required. The llvm-config tool will be
used to determine configuration for HIPACC and must be present in the
environment.

The following variables can be set to tell cmake where to look for certain
components:
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    - Installation prefix
OPENCL_INC_PATH         - OpenCL include path (e.g. -D OPENCL_INC_PATH=/opt/cuda/include)
OPENCL_LIB_PATH         - OpenCL library path (e.g. -D OPENCL_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib64/nvidia)
CUDA_BIN_PATH           - CUDA binary path (e.g. -D CUDA_BIN_PATH=/opt/cuda/bin)

The following options can be enabled or disabled:
USE_POLLY               - Use polly for kernel analysis (e.g. -D USE_POLLY=ON)
USE_JIT_ESTIMATE        - Use just-in-time compilation of generated kernels in
                          order to get resource estimates - option only
                          available for GNU/Linux systems

A possible configuration may look like the following:
cd <hipacc_root>
mkdir build && cd build
mkdir release
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./release
make && make install
